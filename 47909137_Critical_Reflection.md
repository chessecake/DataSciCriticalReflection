## Reflective Report
Through my progression of my data science course I have developed my skills of comprehension on data, identification and analysis of data. The macro skills gained from this course have been one of the most beneficial features of this course, being able to apply theoretical formulas to real world datasets has allowed me to expand my skill set which can be applied to future computer science projects including Version control, logical problem solving and time management.

### Foundations
Solid understanding of data science, requires understanding of the CRISP-DM methodology, the use of this method provides a repeatable and sound method for the identification of patterns in data in the case of a classification problem and important fields of data that can be predicted using influential data. This can be seen implemented in my portfolio 4 where I identified a need for future data prediction,
Understanding of the data provided is the second pivotal step

### Future Uses
I see data science as an important tool in the field of cyber security. The level of data a business will produce in a given day is unable to be processed manually in a time that is able to be actionable, this is where computer processes are required to be able to provide insight into patterns that are unseen. one of data science's biggest selling point in cyber security is the field of AI based monitoring and detection, particularly in products known as system information and event management (SIEM). The collection of log data from a variety data sources is combined into one dataset to which different neural network models can be applied to detect minute changes in computer networks that would otherwise be imperceivable to technicians.
